Problem Statement
While digital gifts wishlists and gifting platforms have grown in popularity for driving engagement, personalization, and smarter purchasing decisions, key limitations remain. Users are missing out on integrations with online stores, third parties, redeemable loyalty points, updated products and access to discount offers. As a result, gifting platforms struggle with low user retention, limited loyalty system integration, and reduced perceived value for both givers and recipients.
There is an opportunity to transform the gifting experience leveraging on AI and its ecosystem. By enhancing personalization, lifecycle awareness, and integrating loyalty systems, platforms can alert users when they can redeem points, offer timely incentives, and encourage continued engagement maximizing the value of gifting with memberships, improving retention, boosting sales for businesses and reduces wastage.
